## Tech stack

[pNpm](https://pnpm.io/): Fast, disk space efficient package manager

[Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please): Release Please automates CHANGELOG generation, the creation of GitHub releases, and version bumps for your projects.

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky): Auto run `lint`, `unit tests`, `build` before commit.

[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/): Simple and performant reactivity for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Frontend Tooling. It uses Rollup and esbuild internally for bundling

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/): Testing Framework.

## Project Structure

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just an extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

Inside your project, you'll see the following directory structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ routes/
        â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory-based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). The `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output during development.

```shell
pnpm start
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite may request a significant number of `.js` files. This does not represent a Qwik production build.

## Production

The production build will generate client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. The build command will use Typescript to run a type check on the source code.

```shell
pnpm build
```
